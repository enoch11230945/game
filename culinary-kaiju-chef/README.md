# 🍳 Culinary Kaiju Chef
## A High-Performance Survival Game Built with Godot 4.5

---

### 🎯 Project Overview

**Culinary Kaiju Chef** is a "survivor-like" game where players control a giant monster chef defending against armies of rebellious food ingredients. Built from the ground up with **data-driven architecture** and **performance-first engineering**.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🚀 High Performance**: Supports 500+ enemies at 60 FPS using object pooling and manual movement algorithms
- **📊 Data-Driven Design**: All game content configurable through Godot resources (.tres files)
- **🔧 Modular Architecture**: Clean separation between systems (`src/`) and features (`features/`)
- **🎮 Complete Game Loop**: Player movement, enemy AI, weapon systems, XP/leveling, upgrades
- **🤖 AI-Assisted Development**: Fully integrated with MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools

### 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

#### **"Good Taste" Engineering Principles**
- **Data over Code**: Game logic driven by configurable resources
- **No Special Cases**: Consistent patterns eliminate edge case handling  
- **Performance by Design**: Manual algorithms avoid engine overhead
- **Decoupled Systems**: EventBus eliminates tight coupling

### 🎮 Gameplay Systems

#### **Core Loop** ✅ Complete
1. **Movement**: WASD controls with smooth CharacterBody2D physics
2. **Combat**: Auto-targeting weapons with multiple projectile types
3. **Enemies**: Area2D-based enemies with manual movement and flocking
4. **Progression**: XP collection, leveling, and upgrade selection
5. **Object Management**: Full object pooling for performance

#### **Data-Driven Content** ✅ Complete
- **Weapons**: Throwing Knife, Fan Knife, Piercer (with upgrade paths)
- **Enemies**: Onion Grunt, Speed Demon, Tank Brute (with unique behaviors)
- **Spawn Waves**: 7 pre-configured enemy waves with scaling difficulty
- **Upgrades**: Projectile count, damage multipliers, cooldown reduction

### 🛠️ Development Tools

#### **MCP Integration** 🔧 Ready
Three integrated MCP servers for AI-assisted development:
1. **GDAI Plugin**: Scene/script creation and debugging
2. **Godot Control**: Project running and output capture  
3. **Editor Integration**: Two-way editor communication

#### **Configuration Files**
- `mcp_config.json`: MCP server configuration

### 🚀 Quick Start

#### **Prerequisites**
- Godot 4.5 (included in project)
- Windows 10+ (primary development platform)
- 8GB RAM minimum for AI tools

#### **Running the Game**
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd culinary-kaiju-chef

# Launch with Godot
../Godot_v4.5-stable_win64.exe/Godot_v4.5-stable_win64.exe project.godot

# Or run directly
../Godot_v4.5-stable_win64.exe/Godot_v4.5-stable_win64.exe res://src/main/main.tscn
```

#### **Architecture Test**
```bash
# Verify all systems are working
../Godot_v4.5-stable_win64.exe/Godot_v4.5-stable_win64.exe --headless --script res://quick_test.gd
```

### 📊 Performance Metrics

#### **Target Performance**
- **60 FPS** with 500+ active enemies
- **<2ms** per frame for core game logic
- **<50MB** memory usage during gameplay

#### **Optimization Techniques**
- Object pooling eliminates garbage collection spikes
- Manual enemy movement bypasses physics engine overhead
- Staggered separation calculations distribute CPU load
- Optimized collision layers minimize detection work

---

### 🔄 Development Workflow

#### **With AI Assistance**
```bash
# Start AI-assisted development session
@mcp gdai-plugin "analyze current project and suggest next feature to implement"

# Test changes immediately
@mcp godot-control "run project and check for errors"

# Iterate based on feedback
@mcp godot-editor "modify scene structure based on performance analysis"
```

#### **Manual Development**
1. **Data First**: Create/modify .tres resources for new content
2. **Test Immediately**: Use quick_test.gd to verify changes
3. **Performance Check**: Monitor with 200+ enemies spawned
4. **Commit Often**: Maintain clean git history
